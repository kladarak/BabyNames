# Pygame Project

This is a simple Python project that uses pygame.
It's a tinder-like app, populating a list of baby names from a text file and allows a user to accept or reject names by pressing left/right keys.

It's AI generated, made using prompts with copilot, including project setup via venv.
Uploaded to github for posterity.
